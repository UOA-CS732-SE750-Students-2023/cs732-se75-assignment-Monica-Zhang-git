# Gift recommendation - React Native app

This mobile app generates gift recommendations using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/). The backend is built using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework and utilizes the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) for generating gift ideas.

Users can input the characteristics of the person they want to send a gift to and click the 'Generate Gift Ideas' button. The app then fetches data from an AWS link where a generate.js file is stored that fetches data from the OpenAI API.

Using AWS to fetch data provides an added layer of security for the OpenAI API Key and makes it more convenient for users to get gift recommendations.

</p>

On the input page, users can enter the characteristics of the person they are buying a gift for, including their age, gender, the price range of the gift, and their hobbies. Once the user has entered this information, they can click the 'Generate Gift Ideas' button to begin the gift recommendation process.

Next, the user is taken to the loading page, where they will wait for the gift recommendations to be generated.

Once the recommendations are ready, the user is automatically redirected to the results page, where they can view the gift recommendations.

If the user wants to generate new gift ideas, they can click the 'Try Again' button to go back to the input page and start over.
